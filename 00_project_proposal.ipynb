    "\n",
    "As global population and urban densification are expected to increase in the 21st century, cities around the world will face many new challenges. According to recent United Nations reports, the world's population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 [(1)](https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population). The proportion of urban dwellers is expected to increase from 55% to 68% over the next 30 years [(2)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html). By 2030, the world will have about 43 megacities with populations of more than 10 million, including Tokyo, New Delhi, Shanghai, Mexico City, and New York. Transportation networks will become less efficient because of increasing congestion due to increased car ownership. As a result, increased congestion, air pollution, and aging infrastructure will affect both the health and overall quality of life of urban populations [(3)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4243514/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite government efforts to develop and promote greener means of transportation in metropolitan areas, the list of cities with severe traffic congestion continues to grow each year [(4)](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/worst-traffic-cities-in-the-world/38/). Recently, New York City became the most congested city in the United States [(5)](https://nypost.com/2021/03/09/nyc-has-americas-worst-traffic-congestion/). Personal cars, cabs, and other ride-sharing alternatives remain very popular as they are usually seen as a more efficient way to get to one's destination and offer more flexibility and comfort to their users than trains, subways, streetcars, and buses. However, with the ever-increasing traffic, are cars always the fastest way to get around town?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will use New York City taxi trip records to study when and where the city is most congested. We will then use this information and combine it with additional data to build machine learning models that can predict travel time, with the ultimate goal of informing people about the best way to get around the city, i.e. by car or other means of transportation."

    "The weather data set does not contain any missing or incorrect values, but a few outliers. These outliers will not be removed from the dataset, as they are only the result of much rarer weather events. Measurements, including temperature, precipitation, and snow depth, are given in imperial units and will be converted to metric units. The snow depth and precipitation columns may contain the character T, which stands for \"Trace amounts\". These characters will be replaced by zeros. The departure temperature (dep_temp), heating degree days (hdd), and cooling degree days (cdd) columns will be dropped because they do not provide useful information for model training. Finally, continuous variables will be grouped according to their level of intensity, and each level will be adjusted to contain a sufficient number of data points. The lowest level (level 0) will correspond to no weather event, while the highest level (level 3 or 4) will correspond to the highest intensity of a weather event. Binning continuous variables tends to improve the performance of a model by introducing non-linearity. The dates will be used later to merge the weather forecast dataset with the primary dataset. A subset of the weather dataset after preprocessing is shown in *Table 2*."

    "Both data sets contain no incorrect or outlier values, but some missing comments, which has no consequence since this column will be dropped later anyway. The columns containing date-related data will be combined and transformed into a date-time format. These date columns will then be used to combine the two datasets. Once combined most columns except for date and holiday type will de removed, as these are the only two variables that can provide useful information for training our models. An additional column containing 1s will be added to the dataset to indicate that these dates are not regular days. Finally, the holiday types will be ordinal encoded, while ensuring that the holidays are ranked by national importance. If two holidays have the same date, the one with the higher rank will take precedence. Feature encoding is a crucial step, as many machine learning algorithms cannot handle non-numeric variables. Later, the dates will be used to merge the combined holidays dataset with the primary dataset. A subset of the vacation dataset after preprocessing is shown in *Table 5*."

Manhattan is the heart of New York City with its many stores, bars, and restaurants and is also one of the most densely populated boroughs. As a result, traffic jams are more likely to occur and special attention must be paid to travel times, which are more likely to vary considerably depending on a variety of factors, including holidays and weather conditions.\n",

Pick-up and drop-off locations do not change significantly during the week, but between weekdays and weekends. However, is the reduction in the number of taxi trips is linked to shorter travel time?"
