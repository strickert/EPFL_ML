    "### Project:\n",
    "In this work, we will first analyze where and when traffic congestion is highest and lowest in New York State. We will then build different machine learning models capable of predicting cab travel times in and around New York City using only variables that can be easily obtained from a smartphone app or a website. We will then compare their performance and explore the possibility of using additional variables such as weather forecasts and holidays to improve the predictive performance of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section:\n",
    "In this section, data will be prepared for the next steps, i.e., exploratory data analysis and machine learning model building. First, we will collect and import the necessary datasets. Next, we will review each of these datasets to fully understand the data and its structure, including the different variables available, their format, and their relevance to the project. Finally, we will perform data cleaning and manipulation, as well as feature engineering, and encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data preparation will be divided into two subsections, the first dedicated to the external datasets (Data Preparation Part I) and the second to the New York City Taxi Trip data set (Data Preparation Part II). Finally, external datasets will be merged with the primary one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "### External Datasets:\n",
    "- Weather Forecast: The 2018 NYC weather forecast was collected from the [National Weather Service Forecast Office](https://w2.weather.gov/climate/index.php?wfo=okx) website. Daily measurements were taken from January to December 2018 in Central Park. These measures are given in imperial units and include daily minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitations, snowfall, and snow depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Holidays: The 2018 NYC holidays list was collected from the [Office Holiday](https://www.officeholidays.com/countries/usa/new-york/2021) website. The dataset contains the name, date, and type of holidays for New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Taxi Zones: The NYC Taxi Zones dataset was collected from the [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/NYC-Taxi-Zones/d3c5-ddgc) website. It contains the pickup and drop-off zones (Location IDs) for the Yellow, Green, and FHV Trip Records. The taxi zones are based on the NYC Department of City Planningâ€™s Neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Taxi Trips: The 2018 NYC Taxi Trip dataset was collected from the [Google Big Query](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/city-of-new-york/nyc-tlc-trips?project=jovial-monument-300209&folder=&organizationId=) platform. The dataset contains more than 100'000'000 Yellow Taxi Trip records for 2018 and contains an extensive amount of variables including the pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts."
